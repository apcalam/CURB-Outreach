        <p class = "about">Isabella is a Cornell junior studying neurobiology and behavior. In high school, Isabella
          participated in Rockefeller University’s Summer Science Research Program (SSRP) and conducted
          research in Dr. Bulloch's Laboratory of Neuroimmunology. Isabella is tremendously grateful to
          SSRP and her mentors because they exposed her to scientific culture, taught her valuable skills,
          and ultimately allowed her to envision herself as a physician-scientist. She hopes to provide the
          same opportunity for high schoolers.</p>

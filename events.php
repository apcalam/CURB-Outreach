      <!--Description of the event-->
      <p class = "about">The goal of this class is to expose the high school students to multiple modes of science
        communication and to allow them to practice scientific writing. We will provide the fundamentals of statistics
        and guide the students through the scientific method as they collect data in the laboratory and prepare their own
        scientific poster.</p>
